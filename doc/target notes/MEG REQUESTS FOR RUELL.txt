2) make the spacing for the cursor uniform instead of "stretchy"
	Ruel: lets discuss this, (Low Priority).
5) make darker cursor "run through" lighter cursors
6) speed up blinking animation
	Ruel: Noted.
7) integrate launched animation
	Ruel: Noted but low priority.
8) scatter the falling sparkles as they travel down the screen, don't make them fall in a straight line

tips suggestions:
level 1) "keep the balls at the ceiling at a minimum. put other balls at the bottom" or something i should word this better haha

level 2) would make a good level 1 but i'd suggest na fixed ang order sa balls instead of random

level 4) where we can introduce the wall bouncing concept so we can hit the balls  on the higher rows without having to clear the lower rows first

other tips na wa pa ko kabaw which level to put them in:
-introducing the boosters...or pwede sad naay separate menu for this lang aron accessable sa player anytime

-kanang mu lose kag life every quit game...ug ang timer para when makakuha ug new life
