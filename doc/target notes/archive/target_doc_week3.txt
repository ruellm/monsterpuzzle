Target for week3 (June 3 - June 10, 2014).

1. Map
	a) Animations on the map 
		clouds, 
		birds, 
	b) Map level handle revise
		- indication of player's current level?

2. Game screens additional buttons
	Quit button--> might as well support --> 
	-----------------------------
	Surrender game? 
	[yes][no way!] [restart]
	----------------------------- 

3. Sound Off/On button (check bubble witch or Titays for reference)

4. Loading animation overlay (this is different from loading screen).
	-- make it an animated sprite NOT just "Loading" text

5. Purchase window
	a. Purchase Booster screen
	b. purchase additional bubble screen (pop-up during gameplay)
	c. Purchase Gold screen
	d. Purchase Life/heart screen

	I suggest i common nalang ang 
		window sprite,
			for multiple item(buying gold and coins)
			for buying single item 
		BUY button, 
		Close button

	(a) and ang content nalang of things to buy ang mag differ IF purchasing a single item just like buying boosters or heart, 
	
	(b)Pero if buying Gold or coins, same style as the other facebook games, present the option as a list to choose.
	
	See bubble witch or any other king.com games for reference.
	Some King.com games are Farm heroes, candy crush saga, pet rescue, etc.

	(c) spliced generic gold bars, gold coin items para ma reuse :)

6. booster graphics
	a) for UI
		- level info screen (with the "+" button para mo purchase cla sa boosters).
		- i display during purchase booster, mo pop-up ang purchase window, then naay booster na paliton na info sa window.
		- idisplay sa top left sa in-game, if player wants to use the boosters during game.
	b) for ingame

7. loading screen (similar to candy crush, bubblemeadow, titays)
- need to explain how progress bar in loading screen should be spliced in person or send sample (c/o Ruell)


8. start planning for the next 3 background concept
